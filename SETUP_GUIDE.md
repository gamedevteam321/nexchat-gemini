## üîç Troubleshooting

### Chat Button Not Visible

3. Clear browser cache and refresh

### API Errors
1. Verify Gemini API key is correct in `site_config.json`
2. Check that `google-generativeai` package is installed
3. Look at ERPNext error logs: `tail -f logs/web.error.log`

### Permission Issues
1. Ensure user has proper permissions for the documents they're trying to create/access
2. Check Role Permissions in ERPNext for the specific DocTypes

### No Response from AI
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Gemini API key has quota remaining
3. Look for errors in browser console and server logs

## üìä Performance Tips

### Optimize for Production
1. **Set up Redis caching** for conversation state (already configured)
2. **Monitor API usage** to avoid hitting Gemini quotas
3. **Use CDN** for static assets in production

### Scale for Multiple Users
1. **Implement rate limiting** for API calls
2. **Add conversation cleanup** for old sessions
3. **Monitor memory usage** for conversation state storage

## üîí Security Considerations

### API Key Security
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or encrypted config in production
- Rotate API keys regularly

### User Permissions
- The system respects ERPNext user permissions
- Users can only access/create documents they have permission for
- Conversation state is isolated per user

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are sanitized before processing
- Gemini responses are validated before execution
- Error handling prevents information leakage
